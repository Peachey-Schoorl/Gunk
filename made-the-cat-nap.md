# Gunk made the cat nap

The first moment I suspected something might be wrong was when my cat didn't come to greet me as I was putting food in his bowl. Usually he's already there, rubbing against my legs, waiting to be fed. With his bowl in hand, I went outside to look for him.

The cat didn't come when I called him or when I rattled the food in his bowl. So I wandered further into the garden.

That's when I saw Gunk, sitting dejectedly on what appeared to be a small pile of dark cloth. Her elbows were resting on her knees,   both hands covering her face. She looked so forlorn, it felt as if she'd been crying.

That was a new one for me. I've never seen Gunk cry. Thus far I've only really seen Gunk happy, angry, annoyed, or biting. Sometimes even all four at the same time.

What on earth could have made Gunk _cry_? Obviously, I just had to find out.

Treading carefully, I moved closer, the cat forgotten. When I got close enough for her to hear me, I quietly asked "Gunk, are you okay?".

She didn't respond. "Gunk?" I repeated, a bit louder. Still, nothing. Louder still: "Gunk!?". This time she responded. Her posture didn't change, her hands still covered her face, but she made a sound: "Waddayawannn?"

So I asked her again "Are you okay?". This time she did move, fast and frighteningly so. Standing up and stretching to her full height, she gave me one of her most powerful glares.

"No!" she shouted at me "I AM NOT OKAY!" She raised her arm and shook her fist at me.

Now, on occasion, I have been told that I am not always the most observant individual. I was beginning to get the feeling Gunk might _not_ have been crying and that, somehow, she was a bit upset with me....

"I _was_ having a nap." Gunk went on, "Sitting in the sun, minding my own business, when _somebody_ came bothering me and **woke me up!**"

Pointing her finger at me angrily, she continued "And you didn't even wake me up for something nice! You _know_ I don't eat that icky stuff!", her finger pointing at the bowl of cat food that was still foolishly held in my hand.

"I'll never be able to get back to sleep _now_!"

She rolled her eyes at me and said "Now you're here with his food I'd better wake him up." With a resounding and heartfelt sigh, she jumped of the pile of cloth, waved her arms and wriggles her fingers.

To my increasing surprise, The pile that I had _though_ was just some black cloth turned out to be my cat! He stretched lazily and ambled over to rub against my legs. I might have said something like "Bwhuehu?" or "Howdadaya?" but, ignoring the both of us, Gunk was already headed of towards her home.

Still somewhat dumbfounded, I put down the bowl of food.

Just before she went into her home, Gunk turned around. "If you wake me up again while I'm trying to find out what that cat is dreaming, you'd better be holding something tasty!" she yelled at me.

And with that, she disappeared into her burrow.
