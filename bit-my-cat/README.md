I came back from the vet with my cat wearing a cone so he couldn't get to his
bandaged tail. It was time to talk with Gunk about this.

Why have you bitten the cat *again*? I asked. You know, all the money I have to
pay the vet I can't use to buy chocolate cookies.

"But he is a murderer!" Gunk yelled. "He murdered my friends babies!"

-"Your friend?"

"Yes! The blackbird living in the hedge. Your cat is always going after my friends 
and their children! So of course I bit him!"

"Ah", I said. "So if I let my cat wear a collar with a bell your bird friends will
know when to fly away from him. And you won't have to bite the cat and I won't 
have to take him to the vet and instead I can go buy chocolate cookies."

"Humpf..." Gunk pouted. "That does sound like a plan"
