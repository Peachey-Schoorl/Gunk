# Gunk came in for Christmas

At the end of every year, the days get shorter and the weather turns gray. People rush about, shopping for gifts and foodstuffs.

When the holidays arive, the days are at their shortest, the larder is full, all the gifts have been wrapped, and expectations are high.

Every year, joining in with the seasonal spirit, I decorate the inside of my house was with lots of lights, tinsel, baubles, doodads, and gimcracks. I have boxes of the stuff packed into the attic. Just getting everything downstairs, opened up and sorted out is no mean task. This year, there was even a real coniferous evergreen tree, much to the chagrin of my cat, as I had to move his favorite cush aside to fit the tree in the living room.

That evening, I sat in my living room enjoying the coziness of it all. It had taken me two days to set up the tree and put up all the decorations, but it was worth all of the effort.

After turning of all the lights, I headed for bed and slept, dreaming of blinking snowmen and flashy colored reindeer.

The next morning, when I came downstairs, something seemed different. It took a moment for my still sleepy head to catch up with what my eyes were telling me.

Between the kitchen door and the living room, there was a trail of decorations, fairy lights and baubles. When I poked my head around the living room door, the cat was laying on a cushion in his favorite spot. Where the tree had stood.

But wait! Where had the tree gone!?

For an instance I thought that the cat, to reclaim the place for his cushion, had dragged the tree outside. 
Or maybe the tree had gone of for a walk outside?

Outside? Of course! I should follow the trail outside to see where the tree had gone!

As I could see, after I walked out of the house, the tree had made it half-way down the garden where it had taken root.

I just stood there perplexed. As I watched, the tree began to rock and shake, shrugging of the remaining tinsel and baubles. When it had completely voided itself of all decorations, its branches parted and Gunk's head appeared.

"Oh, hey!" Gunk beamed at me, "Your tree wasn't looking too good, so felt I'd better take care of it! Its much better now its in the soil and in the sunlight!" Looking up at the sky, I didn't really see any sunlight. I turned my attention back to the tree, and more specifically, to Gunk.

"Gunk," I said, "the tree is _supposed_ to be inside. It is part of my festive decorations!"

"How would you feel", she replied, "inside all the time, with all of those horrible dingums and whatchamacallits all over the place?"

To be honest, I was getting a bit cold out, and as I am rather fond of my dingums, I wouldn't mind being indoors with them. Although, I didn't feel that would improve my standing with Gunk, so I kept that particular sentiment to myself. Instead, I responded with a (in retrospect rather lame) "But, its Christmas!" And, after a moments reflection, added "And what do you mean 'horrible'?" I might be all grown up, but I have to confess, I may have pouted at this point. "I _like_ my dingums! It took me days to put all those decorations up!"

I really _would_ rather be inside.

"Yeah," Gunk said, more puzzled than angry, "what _is_ a Krismess? And Why _did_ you decorate your house like that? Is it your birthday again?"

- - -

At this point, it might be wise to explain that, when we first met, Gunk didn't really understand birthdays. 
She warm up to the idea of birthdays until it was _my_ birthday, and she latched on to the concept of birthday _presents_.

After that, several times a year (completely out of the blue), she would announce it was her birthday and could she have her present now, please. 

But, sometimes, I still get the feeling she doesn't really understand...

So, we trundged back inside, without the tree. I put the kettle on, gave Gunk some chocolade cookies, and started explaining Christmas to her. 

I am sorry to say that I wasn't making a very good job of it. To give you an idea, here are some of the things Gunk exclaimed during this time:

- Since when do you decorate your house for _other_ peoples birthdays?

- You never told me having a birthday two days in a row was an option! 

- People get presents and it _isn't even their birthday_!?

- He's _not_ Chris' father? But he's even called _Father_ Christmas!

- But if Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Kris Kringle, Père Noël, and Babbo Natale are all the same person, how do you know what to call him?

- Wait, did the fizzy drinks people actually _give_ hime clothes?

- You mean, people just _made him up_!?

- How come they don't go around singing the _rest_ of the year?

- _How many_ days of Christmas?

- They don't like to fly, so what I want to know is, how dit it get up in that pear tree in the first place!

- Why didn't I get a card! I'm not even that far away, I live right _there_!

- And you were going to eat all of that alone?

This last remark was after I told Gunk about the Christmas Feast I usually host.
I'd gone through all the preperations but, because all sorts of reasons, this
year, no-one was able to come. It looked like I was going to have to spend the
most festive day of the year alone.

So Gunk invited herself to dinner.

To be fair, she _did_ offer to help. Seeing how her help usually works out, I managed to talk her out of it.
When she finally left, she haughtily declared she wouldn't have been able to help anyway, as she would need at least two days to get _her_ home ugly enough for Christmas.

And with that she walked out the kitchen door.

After I'd finished my tea, I wanted to cleane up the trail of destruction Gunk had left when she moved my tree outside.
Only, the trail was gone. I guess Gunk really did have her work cut out for her, with the amount of decorations she had taken with her.

By the Christmas Eve came around, I was feeling a bit down. Although I always enjoy Gunks company, it would have been nice to have my friends and family around.
Gunk did her best to cheer me up. She left my cat alone, and invented all sorts of games for us to play.
My favourite was turning the fairy light on and of purely with the power of our minds.
Luckily, I could cheat by pressing the switch on the extension cord with my foot, as it was hiden underneath my confortable chair.
After an evening that was fun, despite the lack of people, just before we both headed to our beds, Gunk left me with this wish:

> That your days may grow brighter and the sun shine longer

"Actually," Gunk said, "I _knows_ they will. You just make sure _you_ don't forget it!"
