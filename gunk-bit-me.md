    Sometimes, when she's really grumpy, Gunk will come into the kitchen,
    jump up on the table and bite me. Litterally. Usually in one of my fingers. 
    
    Not _hard_ mind you. Not enough to draw blood. Just enough for me to feel
    her sharp little teeth sink into my skin.
    
    If the mood so takes her, she _might_ hang around and drink some tea, eat
    some chocolate cookies and tell me whats wrong.
    
    Other times she just storms right back out again. I don't mind too much.
    
    It _hurts_, don't get me wrong... But I feel somewhat proud that she
    likes me enough to bite _me_ when she's not feeling alright.
    
    Besides, its worth a little paint to prevent her from bowling over the mailman,
    launching my cat into a tree, or blowing up another traffic light.
    
    I mean, we only had two to begin with!
