Gunk wants to wish you, not a Merry Christmas but:

<p class="flood" style="font-size: 5em;
    line-height: 1;
    text-align: center;"
>
  That your days may grow brighter and the sun shine longer
</p>

Actually, Gunk _knows_ they will, she just though you might have forgotten and could do with some reminding.

Speaking of which, did we ever tell about that time Gunk came into the house for Christmas? No!?

Well... As a Christmas treat, here it is: [_Gunk comes in for Christmas_](https://medium.com/peachey-schoorl/gunk-comes-in-for-christmas-b555c4a929fe)
