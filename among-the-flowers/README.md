# Gunk among the flowers

In the spring, when all the world is in bloom, the garden is a riot of colors. For instance, the large tree at the bottom of the garden has bronze-brown leaves and a dark-green, mossy trunk. It is covered in a blossom of tiny, bright yellow flowers. They fall from the tree in their thousands and cover the bottom of the garden in a lush tapestry of yellow gold.

Like a child in autumn, kicking up leaves, Gunk runs around and throws up enough of a flurry to make the carpet move like the waves of a sea.

I can see her, looking out into the garden from my kitchen window.

She's having so much fun with this, that she doesn't come in to the house for tea (and cookies) for several days.

Its the fifth or sixth day when her game changes. Instead of picking up, throwing about and kicking around, Gunk starts to make shapes from the tiny yellow flowers.

I have a lot of work to do that day, so I only see her when I am standing in the kitchen, waiting for the water to boil. Each time, Gunk makes more elaborate forms than the time before.

It starts with a crown. Then a cape to match. Next the cape becomes so long and wide, she has trouble turning when she trots about. The last thing I see her make is almost as large as a cat, and roughly the same shape.

I don't get to see what else she makes as I've go to go to town, but I'm sure she'll tells me all about it when she finally comes into the house for tea and cookies.

On my way back from town, two streets from my house, I see the mailman talking with the police constable. In itself, this is not so remarkable, but this time it drew my attention. Maybe it was the fact that the mailman looked rather pale. As if he 'd just had a bit of a shock.

I don't know, the constable said, looking around with a look somewhere between confusion and bewilderment. When turned the corner, I swore I saw him" with a nod to the mailman, "wrestling with big fellow who was pulling at his mail bag"

"Oh... nothing special." Gunk said, failing to look as innocent as she was trying to look. "But I did get a postcard today."

Looking out of the kitchen window, I noticed that there seemed to be a lot less of those little yellow flowers laying about.

Maybe it would be better _not_ to ask Gunk how or where (of from who) she managed to get her postcard...
