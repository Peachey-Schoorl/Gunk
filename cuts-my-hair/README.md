# Gunk cuts my hair

This morning, I woke up bald. Not “bold”, as in brave and eager to face the day. Rearing and roaring. But “bald”, as in, without hair.

I didn’t notice at first. Not until I reached the bathroom, that holds the only mirror that I have in the house. For a moment I thought that I had an uninvited guest. I did not have much hair on my head to begin with, as the barber had sheered my skull to a close-cropped coupe only days before. But even those mere millimeters were enough to surprise me. Especially with my eyebrows missing.

That made the strange face in the mirror look even more surprised than I already felt.

Rather groggy (and half thinking I might still be asleep), all of this could have been a bizarre dream. I made my way downstairs where my cat was meowing in a most desperate fashion. When I neared his hiding place, behind the large chair in the living room, I managed to coax him out with soothing sounds and tasty treats.

Seeing my cat made me realize it was _not_ a dream. The same thing which had befallen me in my sleep had also happened to him. He sat, in the middle of the living room carpet, licking the taste of fish from his paws, completely Au-natural. That is to say, with not a single hair on his wrinkly house-cat body. At that moment, Gunk came into my house.

Now, it's not that I think of Gunk as soon as anything breaks or vanishes or goes wrong. The plumbing might break, or the WIFI not work, or the stove accidentally catch on fire, or all of my chocolate cookies unexpectedly run out, _entirely_ without her being involved. However, appearing at this _very_ moment, her involvement did seem more likely.

Somehow, I would have expected her to be boisterous about her latest feat. I wasn’t sure if I was mad at her or just mildly upset, but seeing the sad look on her face did put me in a friendlier frame of mind. When she had climbed up onto the kitchen table and sat down, she hadn’t even greeted me. Or asked for cookies. I was beginning to get slightly worried, so I asked her how she was.

“I don’t understand,” she wailed, “it _should_ have worked!” Gunk thought I would be feeling sad about having such short hair. I tried to explain to her that I had cut my hair on purpose because I wanted a different hairstyle. But the entire concept of having your hair _cut_ was alien to Gunk. Apparently, if Gunk wanted a different length of hair, a different style, or even a different color, she only needed to concentrate real hard to make it happen. She thought I had lost my ability to do the same…

Wanting to cheer me up, she had decided to make make a contraption to grow my hair back out. But when she had fired the machine at me, it had done the exact opposite, and she was at a total loss as to why. In her anger and despair, she had depilated the cat on her way out. Sadly, it did not do much to make her feel better. Although, as she told me about that specific part, she did _almost_ seem to smile.

“Things I make _always_ work like I want them to,” she said. “Do you think I’m becoming… _grownup_?” Poor Gunk. She looked absolutely appalled. So I asked her if she couldn’t fix it, or try again, or build something else?

“I _could_ try to fix it,” she pondered, biting her lip, “but I just don’t know. It should’ve worked before.” She seemed to gather herself together a bit. “I’ll try,” she said and nodded her head. With that, she jumped off the table and headed for the cat flap.

While she was gone, I set about my morning routine, as usual. Or as usual as one can after having unexpectedly become glabrous (meaning: without hair). Even the cat showed less enthusiasm than it would normally have, when it settled in the middle of my newspaper, just as I was about to read it.

I had finished my newspaper, and the cat was hidden from sight again. As I was putting away my breakfast things, Gunk came storming in through the cat-flap and rounded the corner into the living room. A battle-yell came from the living room, followed by a sound that can best be described as “Kerrrrrr-tzhing”. The next moment my cat shot out of the living room and flew through the kitchen, exiting through the cat-flap at full speed. It happened so fast that I couldn’t be absolutely sure, but the blur that sped by seemed to have been rather hairy. And slightly blueish.

With a pleased look on her face, Gunk strolled into the kitchen with a large, longish thing resting on her right shoulder. The thing she was carrying looked a lot like a popsicle stick and some twigs, stuck together with elastic bands, covered in moss, tufts of wool, and hair. There was a single blue-blackish feather sticking out at an angle. A faint, light blue glow hovered around its edges.

“It worked!” Gunk squealed. “I gave the cat his hair back! So…” she continued, “are you ready?” But before I could really answer, she swung the thing from her shoulder, aimed it at me and the faint blue glow became more distinct and shot towards me. For a very brief instant, the world turned blue, and then everything was normal again. I blinked my eyes a couple of times, to get rid of the blue after-image, and gingerly lifted my hand to my head. To my surprise, my fingers felt hair. My eyebrows were back too.

My gaze turned to Gunk. She had dropped her hair-repair gun, which lay on the floor smoldering, emitting trails of smoke. Her grin was even larger than before and she was doing some sort of victory dance. To be honest, I was rather relieved that it _had_ indeed worked. I might have even done a little shimmy myself.

You see, I had a meeting with my publishers later that day. They wanted to publish a range of children’s books. If I could convince them that some of my ideas were worth keeping, it could be a bit of a breakthrough for me. That was the reason I had a haircut in the first place. Gunk’s effort to restore my hair had made it a bit longer than I usually wore it, and it also felt a bit more curly. However, I’m sure that would beat showing up **without eyebrows** any day. I felt a lot more self-assured as I headed out to catch the bus into town.

The meeting went quite well, although I didn’t entirely understand all of their remarks about me being a hip writer (in touch with kids these days) until it was evening. Standing in front of my bathroom mirror, brushing my teeth, was the first time I could see _exactly_ what Gunk had done to my hair.

I guess what really made the publishers take notice was not the half-length, curly hair. Although that did give me a rather charming, boyish charm. No, what _I_ think stood out to them _might_ have been the fact that, instead of its usual color, large parts of my hair were a fetching, blackish-**blue**.

I’m _sure_ Gunk hadn’t done that on purpose. Or, well, at least _reasonably_ sure…
