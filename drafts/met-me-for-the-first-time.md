# Gunk met me for the first time

The first time I met Gunk she bit me.

Not an affectionate nibble, but a [..] drawing blood. 

I had to go see the doctor and get shots against tetanus and rabies, just to be safe.

The reason she bit me was my cat.  

Or more, because of what my cat did.

What I hadn’t realised at the time is that, of course, there had to be a reason why the previous owners had wanted to leave their home...

I remember when I first met Gunk. I had moved here just a few months before, during the winter. “Here” being a cute little house, in a cute little town. Because of the cold, there wasn’t much I could do about the garden. There were all sorts of things to do and fix in the house, though, so I did that instead.

The garden hadn’t been kept up to shape by the previous owners and there were bushes and brambles and [onkruid] everywhere. The grass had grown and I could barely see the bottom of the garden because of all the green.

But now winter was over and the weather was getting more mild and it seemed like a good time to start doing things in the garden. So I did.

This is when I asked about her name and Gunk bit me, hard.

Gunk doesn’t like me being stupid or asking stupid questions. She will roll her eyes, give me a look, ignore me or kick at me if I do.

I think, especially in the beginning, Gunk also didn’t like me asking questions that made her think of her parents and her family.

It might be nice if this is the story where Gunk demonstrates (parts of) her “magic” abilities to hide, freeze people, etc.

I came back from the vet with my cat wearing a cone so he couldn't get to his bandaged tail. It was time to talk with Gunk about this.

Why have you bitten the cat *again*? I asked. You know, all the money I have to pay the vet I can't use to buy chocolate cookies.

"But he is a murderer!" Gunk yelled. "He murdered my friend's babies!"

-"Your friend?"

"Yes! The blackbird living in the hedge. Your cat is always going after my friends
and their children! So of course I bit him!"

-"Ah", I said. "So if I let my cat wear a collar with a bell your bird friends will
know when to fly away from him. And you won't have to bite the cat, and I won't
have to take him to the vet and instead I can go buy chocolate cookies."

"Humpf..." Gunk pouted. "That does sound like a plan"
