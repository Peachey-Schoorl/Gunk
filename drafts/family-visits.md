# Gunk’s family visits

It was a morning much like any other. I was sitting in my study, thinking about important things. Like what to write about next. Or world peace. Or my shopping list for the week. One of those. Right then, I heard Gunk come in through the cat flap, so I decided to go see what she was up to.

When I walked into the kitchen, I noticed that Gunk was very excited. I might have missed it, with my mind still on important things, but there were a few subtle clues that gave it away. It might have been the fact that she hadn't taken the effort to scare the cat, who was sitting in his usual corner looking confused and wary. Or maybe it was the cartwheels she was making across my table top, yelling “Hoo! Ha! Hoo-ha!”.

Anyway, I picked up on it pretty quick and asked her if anything was going on. She stopped making cartwheels across my kitchen table and started jumping up and down instead.

“They’re coming! They’re coming!” she shouted, “They’re coming today!”

But before I could ask who “they” were, Gunk stood still all of a sudden. “There’s still so much to do!” she exclaimed with a look of shock on her face. With a cry that sounded something like” Erk!”, she ran to the edge of the table, jumped off, headed for the cat-flap and banged her way straight through into the garden.

I exchanged a glance with the cat, who’s  look made it clear he had no idea what was going on. He also didn't look like he felt much inclined to investigate, so I thought I’d better go out and see what this was all about.

When I got to the bottom of the garden, Gunk was running in and out of her home. She was throwing things away, moving others inside, and sometimes (forgetting which was which) she moved stuff back in that she had thrown out moments before.

I tried to get her attention but she was such a blur of activity, I might as well have been invisible. After ten of fifteen minutes, Gunk seemed to have worn herself out to a point where she noticed me again. When I asked her _who_ were coming she gave me an annoyed look.

“Don’t just stand there asking silly questions,” she reprimanded me, “make yourself useful! We’re going to need lots of tea! And cookies! Make sure there are enough cookies!”

With that, she ran back inside. I waited for a couple of minutes, but as it didn't look like she would be out again, I thought I’d better go see a man about some cookies.

After I got back from the store, I put away the cookies (I had bought eight boxes), filled the kettle as far as it would go, and it put on the stove. Next I headed back out to look for Gunk. Maybe she’d have settled down enough by now to tell me who were coming and what all the fuss was about.

When I found her,, Gunk was sitting on the ground outside her burrow, wearing her best outfit, looking expectantly up at the sky. I sat down next to her and asked about “they” again. She wouldn't answer until I had made tea and set another overflowing kettle on. And even then, only after I had tried to convinced her that eight boxes of chocolate cookies would be more than enough, but it would be helpful to know _just how many_ folks we were waiting for.

“Oh,” Gunk waved her hand at me,  apparently feeling much more in control of herself, “you know, just my parents and my brother”. Of course I knew Gunk had parents. I mean, it makes sense. Everyone has parents. Its just that it never occurred to me she actually, you know, had parents. 

I mean, rain doesn't have parents. Nor does the wind. Or an earthquake. Or hurricanes.

And a brother. Having four times as many Gunk around made me wonder if I _had_ indeed bough enough cookies.

I didn't have time to wonder about it for too long, as something was happening that made Gunk jump up and wave her arms at the sky. When I looked up, I saw three birds flying in our direction.

Gunk got more excited and, besides waving at the birds more frantically, she also started jumping up and down.

The birds glided to a stop a few feet away. Close by, I noticed three figures, roughly the same size as Gunk, sitting on the birds. One of the birds had a rope around it's neck, which it's driver used as reins. He looked a lot older than Gunk. So that was probably her father. He got of the birds slowly, helped by a younger version of himself, who had jumped of his bird as soon as they landed. Gunks brother?

Gunk had run directly to the third figure, who I assumed must be her mother, threw her arms around her and disappeared into a close hug.

I was about to move towards them myself when, what was probably Gunk's father, threw me a look and I froze where I stood. It wasn't the angry stare I sometimes got from Gunk, but it had the same effect. I couldn't move. I tried to call to Gunk for help but all I could manage was "Uhmp".

Finally, when Gunk and her mother broke their embrace, Gunk noticed what was going on.

"Dad, do you always have to embarrass me in front of my friends!?"

"So who _is_ the big'n?" her probably brother asked.

-"Don't be dense. He's a friend." Gunk barked at him. I was beginning to understand whom she had practiced her eye-rolling on.

"Oooh. A friend, is 'e?'" her brother taunted. 
 
[ "Take that back!" Gunk yelled.]
[-"Make me!" her brother yelled back and took of on his bird.]

Gunk didn't even bother answering. She just bolted straight towards the bird her father was holding by a string, jumped on it's back and took off after her brother in a flurry of feathers.

Their shrill battle cries echoed around us as they raced each other in circles around the gardens.

"My apologies, sir" her father said, disengaging his freezing stare. He looked about a bit sheepish, "but you don't right look like folk she'd normally run about with, if ya' catch my drift."

Not really catching his drift, I just nodded politely  and assured him there was no need to apologize. [No harm done, and so forth.]

[The birds land exhausted but Gunk and her brother go at it some more on the ground, rejoining us looking rumpled, happy, and grinning]

After Gunk and her brother had landed and things settles down a bit, I was properly introduced to everyone. After that, Gunk suggested we'd go into my house to have some tea.

"We can do it properly. We'll all sit on the table and use cups."

Gunk walked in front with her father and brother, I followed making small talk with Gunk's mother. Her brother was gamboling and running and jumping all the while.

"Has Gunk always been this fond of tea?" I asked. "Oh, aye" her mother responded. "She always felt it was Very Grown Up to have tea." She glance up at me with a smile. "I'm sure she somehow manages to behave herself when there's tea on the table." she said soft enough for only me to hear.

Gunk's mother raised her voice again, "She'd join us for tea whenever she could. She always had room for another cuppa, didn't ya, dear?"

Gunk nodded her head gracefully, confirming her mothers words. It was almost ladylike.

"Nowadays, I have _my_ tea with cookies. Do you know about those?"

-"Oh, aye." her mother answered "I've had some of those. Not really my taste. Too dry in the mouth. No' enough flavor."

"Well," Gunk said, a look of mischief growing on her face as she walked a bit faster, reaching the catflap, "I think you'll like these... 

They're **chocolate** cookies!"
