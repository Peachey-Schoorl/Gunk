# Gunk is ill

Gunk was sitting in her burrow feeling bored.

Now, this may surprise you, but Gunk never really gets bored.

She can always think of something to do. Or someone to do it to.

But today, all chores had been done, all her friends had been visited, everything in the world was as it should be.

So Gunk decided to she would be bored for a while. Just to see what it was like.

First she tried being bored in her burrow. She sat on her favorite chair, dangled her legs, and blew rasperries at no one in particular. It might interest the reader to know that, bored or otherwise, that was also her only chair, as she had eaten the other one. Or two. She couldn't quite remember.

Feeling that being bored really didn't work for her sitting down, she decided to try being bored standing up. As that did not greatly improve matters, she decided to be bored on-the-go and headed outsided.

She took her regular route across the garden, under the hedge, over the road, round (and round and round) the roundabout, stop at the bus stop. And then back across the road again.

Although great fun, Gunk felt being bored on the go might also not be quite right for her.
So she decided to drop in for a cup of tea (and maybe a chocolate cookie or three).

This is when Gunk found out us humans can be ill.

I was lying in bed, feeling like death warmed over, on a cracker. Dragged in by the cat.

In no uncertain terms: I was rather ill and feeling more than a little sorry for myself.

My nose was running, I had a fever, my muscles were sore, and my head ached.

The latter was not much improved when Gunk, feeling she was getting the hang of being bored, started yelling my name at the top of her lungs.

She may (or my not) have heard my groans as, not a minute later, my bedroom door banged open and Gunk bound in. Or bounced in. Whichever it was, it ended on my pillow, jumping up and down, yelling "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE UP!".

By the third or fourth attempt she must have noticed something was wrong, as she stopped both the jumping and the yelling. Much to my relieve. Or she may just have felt that jumping and yelling are not part of being bored.

I managed to convey to her that my head hurt. And no, not because I bumped it. And that my nose was runny. Again, not because I bumped it. She didn't really catch on until I explained to her that I was running a fever, and that this was a bad thing.

Apparently, Gunk had never been ill a single day in her live.

So instead of being bored, she decided she would be ill for a while.
