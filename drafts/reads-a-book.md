# Gunk reads a book

<!--

Premise: Gunk does not read books, she does not need to. She can eat a book and get its meaning that way. We do not know how this works. ✨ Magic ✨. We also don't know what happens if Gunk does not finish a book, as that has never been know to happen. In fact, Gunk has never been known not to finish what she started (eating). 

The author may or may not have offered Gunk an ereader to read at some point. If that did happen, we don't know what the outcome was.

We do know why Gunk doesn't eat news papers: because they don't taste nice. Not the paper and ink, she likes them fine, but the flavor of the news itself is not much to her taste.
